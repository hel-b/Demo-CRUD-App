## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Node.js | MongoDB | Express | Nodemon | Body-parser | EJS |
dotenv

Based on npm packages, we built a Star Wars-themed CRUD system. - Express served
to simplify HTTP requests. -Body-parser handled our form data and returned them
as a body property on our request object

- MongoDB npm package was utilized to interface with our remote mongoDB atlas
  database -EJS - as a template engine, we utilized EJS to easily generate HTML
  content responses from our database -Nodemon automatically refreshed our
  project while in development to save time and the effort of refreshing Node
  -Dotenv added to manage database credentials

## Lessons Learned:

It's better to leverage APIs than trying to reinvent the wheel. Also,
double-check check your secrets are safe before pushing to GH!
